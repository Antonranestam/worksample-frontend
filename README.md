## The application

The application you will be creating is a invoicing app that contains a table of invoices. The invoices can be sorted and filtered.

Filtering is done by clicking on the icon with three dots in the upper rigth corner.

When clicking an invoice it should open up a detailed view of the selected invoice.

We expect you to create the descibed application in your javascript framework of choise, you are also free to use any kind of css pre-processor or just regular css.
